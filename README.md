# bBoulder

Created for the purpose of advertising bBoulder; a fictional indoor bouldering centre that also focuses on maintaining physical health. The website will showcase the facilities through images/videos, provide useful information regarding the location and services available.

## User Experience (UX)

### Considerations:

#### Strategy:
* Responsiveness = The site should be responsive on all devices from mobile to desktop
* Accessibility = the site should meet all accessibility requirements, allowing anyone to use regardless of their abilities/needs.
* What does the client (bBoulder) expect from the site? = They want this to promote their business and encourage visits to their centre.
* What do they really need? = They need a website produced that is responsive, functional and professional 
* Audience = B2C; general public (all ages)
* What makes bBouldering special? = It has a focus on wellbeing/injury prevention.
* Why would a user want to use this? = They would be able to access information regarding; services, classes, pricing, location, imagery, safety information.

#### Scope:
I have listed the possible features below and ranked 1-5 in level of importance/relevance to user needs (1 being most important and viable/feasable):
* Classes for children and adults (1) 
* Location/map (1)
* Site navigation (1)
* Accessibility (1)
* Social networking information and links (1)
* Wellbeing services; Ice baths, osteopathy, stretching/warm up/cool down area with touchscreen technology (1)
* Logo (1)
* Ethos (2)
* Booking information (2)
* Safety information (2)
* Images/gallery (2)
* Background image (2)
* Video footage - iframe (3)
* Fully functional calendar for bookings (4)
* Animated climber that climbs up and down on the side of the page when scrolling (5)
* Bar to indicate current level of busyness (5)

Following research and review of scope, I have decided not to include:
* The animated climber - I believe this would distract from the content, would require levels of JavaScript that are outside of the project scope and would take up more time than appropriate for the value provided.
* Bar to indicate current level of busyness - This would require levels of JavaScript that are outside of the project scope currently, and do not feel it is entirely necessary as far as user/business needs are concerned. Could potentially implement in the future.
* Fully functional calendar for bookings - again this will require JavaScript that is outside the scope of this project at this time. Could potentially implement in the future. For now I intend to include a mock form for bookings including a datepicker.

I will be including the remaining features within in the site, implementing with HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap.
